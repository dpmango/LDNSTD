          blockquote We are delighted that we can now offer guided match day tours so come and take a behind the scenes view of London Stadium only hours before the players battle it out on the pitch.
          p This is a different style of tour as this tour will be guided in small groups and everyone on the tour will be accompanied by one of our exceptional Experience Makers. Our guides are full of character, knowledge and stories about West Ham United, athletics and the incredible feat of architecture that is the London Stadium, so you will be entertained on your journey through the stadium.

          p The popular areas of this tour will still be visited, but the excitement of a match day will be in the air.
